# Opacity

The terminal window can be made transparent through the "Opacity"-setting.
Note that this controls the transparency of the entire window, including the title bar.

```json
{
  // Make the window see-through (applies to the entire window, including the title bar)
  // 0 (invisible) - 100 (opaque)
  "Opacity": 80
}
```
